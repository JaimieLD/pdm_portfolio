# Peer Feedback
## Direct Report (Process Analyst) - July 2023
* **Context**: 2023 Mid-Year Check-in Feedback received from a direct report
* **Feedback in response to the question “What are the things I have done well to support you in your role?”**: “*You have helped bring a lot of clarity to the natural ambiguity that seems to surround this role. You have helped me define goals and make specific action plans to achieve them. You have been very communicative about goings-on and how I can support various initiatives. You have also been key in helping me understand political context and implications about anything I am engaged in. All of these are great for someone with my personality. Additionally, you show great compassion and empathy in allowing me to deal with the many challenges in my personal life, which I hope makes me more successful in my work.*”
* **Feedback in response to “Please share any additional comments or feedback on how I could better set you up for success or better manage the BA team overall.”**: “*Nothing else comes to mind. It’s not hyperbolic to say that you demonstrate all the great leadership traits any leadership training would promote. I used to lead teams and teach leadership and management training and you have the whole gamut covered. Plus, it’s all genuine and organic, and not just a leader going through the motions that they read in a book, which is awesome, being that I’m someone under your leadership.*”

## Direct Report (Technical Project Manager) - May 2023
* **Context**: 2023 Mid-Year Check-in Feedback received from a direct report
* **Feedback in response to “What’s going well that I should continue doing to help you or the team be successful this year?”**:<br>“***Situation**: I have been lucky to have attended Jaimie’s standups, project calls, and team meetings. Through many of these meetings, I have observed the following behaviors.<br><br>**Behavior**: Jaimie’s super power is that she carries deep empathy and understanding of the people around her. She has a strong ability to put herself in others shoes - which enables her to build rapport with others, make a positive influence, make sound business decisions, elicit the right requirements, and navigate sensitive situations. This is why so many people trust in Jaimie.<br><br>Jaimie has excellent communication skills. She is a people person, who easily connects with others and wants others to feel included and engaged. Jaimie can read a room and communicate professional project overviews with next steps and actions - and at the same time she can quickly pivot and quip a witty joke for her audience that puts everyone at ease.<br><br>Jaimie is also a strong writer, and has drafted up the first version of our team templates, which include project briefs and charters. These templates will be useful for the team and our customers as we get on the cadence of intaking and delivering projects.<br><br>**Impact**: These super powers combined give Jaimie very strong leadership skills that others naturally follow. I am truly inspired by Jaimie’s natural ability to bring people together, tell a story, connect, and to make a positive influence. Jaimie is patient with others and often gives them more time than needed to ensure that they feel like they have been heard and accounted for. She puts people and team, first. Bottom line - Jaimie’s positive outlook and demeanor is contagious to those around her and her team, and it makes everyone better for it. To be successful this year, Jaimie should continue in the same direction and maintain course; “keep on keeping on” because she leads the way and others follow.*”

## Peer Bar Raiser (SR Manager, Avionics) - May 2023
* **Context**: Feedback received from a peer bar raiser on a hiring panel for which I was an interviewer
* **Feedback**: “*Jaimie, you are so articulate and concise! I really appreciated your feedback write-up and how you summarized your thoughts. Not sure if this is just a natural gift you have or if you learned it along the way, but I just wanted to let you know that you really stand out in how you communicate and share your thoughts. Just from this debrief you’ve made me think about how I need to do better. I hope you are a coach and/or mentor to someone. You definitely have a lot to offer others. Oh, and by the way, any coaching tips or constructive feedback you have for me would be much appreciated! Thanks Jaimie!*”

## Direct Report (Product Analyst) - May 2023
* **Context**: 2023 Mid-Year Check-in Feedback received from a direct report
* **Feedback in response to the question “What are the things I have done well to support you in your role?”**: “*I appreciate how supportive you are of me as a whole person, not just a work resource. It’s refreshing and incredibly valuable to me to not just be heard and supported in my work, but also in my relationships with coworkers and in encouraging me to take self-care measures so I don’t burn myself out.<br><br>From a work perspective, I love that I can use you as a sounding board and I really value your input and direction on how best to achieve the things I want to do to help the team. It’s super helpful for me to work through my ideas with someone to distill them down into an actionable direction.<br><br>I also really appreciate when you provide feedback from other team members (I welcome constructive feedback too!) and other team member context as it helps me to triangulate the dynamics I sense but can’t always put my finger on. This helps me navigate my work relationships easier when I’m not trying to guess where I stand.*”

## Direct Report, Consultant (Product Analyst) - March 2023
* **Context**: In response to the “send-off” message I sent to the team in advance of the employee’s departure
* **Feedback**: “*Thank you so much for the kind words, taking the time to write that, and for your overall support in my sabbatical! This email was easily one of the kindest and most supportive thing a Manager has done for me in terms of leaving a project or transitioning to something new. You are such a great leader and I look up to you so much!*”
