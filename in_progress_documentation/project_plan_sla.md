## Project Charter & Objectives
As Company aims to mature it’s tools and processes related to mission critical data, it’s also crucial to define the expectations and needs between data providers and data consumers. The objective of this project is to stand-up a skeleton structure of SLA’s between TeamA (data provider) and TeamB (data consumer) to serve as a stop-gap measure until such time as the ET sponsored data contracts project has been fully executed.

## What is in scope?
* A standardized process for assigning issue severity to data issues surfaced by TeamB that uses objective reasoning and data to inform the severity ranking relative to company goals and initiatives
* A set of expectations pertaining to both (1) the inputs provided by TeamB to properly triage data issues and (2) the escalation handling of data issues by TeamA

## What is not in scope?
* Dictating SLA’s between TeamA as a data consumer and source systems, such as SystemA, as data providers - this scope is encompassed by the ET sponsored data contracts initiative
