# Product Brief: ToolName "CR" v1
 
*Notes:*
* *All the contents of this document have been scrubbed of real names, references to tools/systems/hardware, and any other otherwise sensitive or potentially proprietary information.*
* *This document is regularly maintained in Atlassian Confluence, so some minor changes have been made to accommodate the formatting constraints outside of Confluence.*
* *All contents of this document are my own work, though not an exhaustive representation of my inputs. I have chosen to omit some sections where the inputs were supplied by other parties to limit the scope of this document to examples of my own work for the purposes of evaluating my skillset and capabilities.*
* *This write-up was in support of a new feature to an existing custom software solution, so there is context that the full project/product team already had regarding the tools referenced that may not be fully captured in this document.*

### Summary

#### Problem Statement

The "ECR" (RedactedToolName) process presently is the largest bottleneck in the overall "CM" process for the RedactedBusinessUnitInfo. Specifically, the ability to initiate the process as well as identify status, actions/next steps, and responsible parties for actions does not exist so "ECR" tickets stagnate at various stages of their lifecycle for weeks, months, or in extreme cases years before being closed out.

#### Opportunity

By utilizing RedactedToolName APIs to surface up "ECR" tickets within the RedactedToolName interface, users would be able to quickly drill down to view open actions assigned to them and easily navigate into supporting workflows within one cohesive UI, allowing for immediate action to be taken. Simply by surfacing up the data in a navigable way, RedactedToolName would drastically reduce the cycle time of the "CM" process. By further integrating and automating inputs between the "ECR" ticket and the "IA" step, there would be a drastic reduction in touch-time for executing on the activities as well as a reduction in human error in the inputs.

### Business Value / Success Metrics

#### Impact

Streamlined "CR" management will lead to a drastic reduction in overall "CM" process cycle time as "CRs" have been identified as the largest bottleneck in the overall process.

#### Reach

A successful tool supporting the "CR" process would be leveraged by, at minimum, the entire "CDMA" and "RE" community â€“ a user base of approximately ### individuals. The dashboard & search functionality could have broader usage across the business than can presently be estimated. (Possible user base of #,###+ individuals.)

#### Time Criticality

There are inefficient work arounds available today, so this effort is not blocking production efforts. However, there is a high error rate with the manual work arounds, so the goal is to provide MVP functionality within 1-quarter and then to reevaluate needs and urgency for follow-up iterations.
