  * ***Was so well received by the executive leadership team that this format was mandated as the new standard for any such budget requests within the business unit moving forward.***

### Estimated Labor Cost Reduction Summary
* **Total estimated efficiency gains and labor cost reduction implications for YTD thru YYYY = $9,586,140**
* **Total estimated efficiency gains and labor cost reduction implications for YTD thru Q2-YYYY = $22,933,764**

This analysis does not capture cost reduction as a result of reduced manufacturing rework.

## Resource & Staffing Analysis
### Prior Estimate (Q4-YYYY)
The resource and staffing estimates provided in Q4-YYYY were best estimates at the time, but have since been determined to have been deficient in:

* Accurately capturing all functionality needed within the team, roles not captured in original SWAG estimate:
  * Delivery Manager/Scrum Master
  * Quality Assurance
*	Accurately capturing the level of effort and deliverables for Tool
*	Accurately capturing the level of effort of supporting other products within the Team Software Portfolio

These oversights were not the result of poor planning or execution but rather limited understanding due to resource constraints at the time of estimating. Since the original SWAG estimates were provided both the Project Manager and Product Manager, in tandem with the UX researchers and designers have conducted more thorough pain point analysis. This research has yielded additional scope not originally captured.
<br><br>
This additional scope requires either temporary additional headcount, or additional time to execute on.

### Proposed Path Forward (Thru Q2-YYYY)
In an effort to develop and deploy software solutions to support 10x BusinessUnit delivery, the ask is to support the following resource/staffing plan (per the Proposed column) through Q2-YYYY.
<br><br>
This is to allow Team to develop a robust Software Development team and processes while also actively deploying best-in-class software solutions. Maintaining a temporary presence of experienced contract resources allows us to develop our processes faster and avoid falling into common pitfalls of “new” software development teams by leveraging their expertise and lessons learned.

 </tr>
</table>

#### Technical Product Manager
There is no perceived change needed to this function of the original resource plan.

#### UX Researcher/Designer
In addition to supporting multiple products (Tool1 and Tool2 currently, possibly Tool3 in the near future), UX teams generally are comprised of specialists in:

*	Research
*	Design
  
Even with 2 headcount supporting UX, both resources are at capacity today and have not yet provided to support to other products in the Team portfolio other than Tool1.

#### Developer
The original assumption of 4 Software Development Engineers (SDE’s) was based on the notion that 1 person would be able to fully support each of the following functions:

*	Data Engineer/Data Science
*	System Architect
*	Gateway
*	Front End
  
This did not account for:

*	The scale of Tool
*	The ability of Team to accommodate bandwidth demands for onboarding and training FTE resources
*	The ability of Team to support a portfolio of solutions beyond Tool

#### Delivery Manager
At the time of the original estimate, one person was attempting to serve as:

*	Project Manager
*	Product Manager
*	Delivery Manager/Scrum Master

This is not sustainable or scalable and the original resource plan neglected to account for the Delivery Manager/Scrum Master functionality.

#### Quality Assurance
At the time of the original estimate there was no planning for automated testing and an assumption was made that the development team would be able to perform all rigorous testing needed prior to each release.

The present SDE team is at capacity and with the amount of feature releases scheduled for both Tool1 and Tool2 there is a headcount’s worth of work in this space.

### Impacts of Prematurely Reducing Staffing Resources
If the decision were to be made to reduce contract staffing support, then the schedule for all deliverables would double, at minimum – depending on the areas where staffing would be reduced.

Risk: In 6-months’ time will there be pushback from leadership on the team's inability to quickly deliver needed solutions and functionality?

## Additional Context
### False Equivalencies
There is no other group to deliver these solutions or do this work for BusinessUnit.

Various groups within BusinessUnit programs have tried to be self sufficient in developing software or software-like solutions and have:

*	Found that they do not have the bandwidth to support
*	Found that they do not have the resources to scale these solutions
*	Been unable to achieve standardization in processes across programs due to ad-hoc solution development

As a result, these various groups have approached Team to take ownership of these tools including:

*	Tool1
*	Tool2
*	Potentially Tool3

Additionally, there is no central group in a position to support these development needs as BusinessUnit:

*	Does not categorically support custom software, they have specific teams for internally developed tools (i.e. System)
*	Is understaffed (see Lessons Learned from Elsewhere at Company)

### Lessons Learned from Elsewhere at Company
#### BusinessUnit Today
In the recent BusinessUnit1/BusinessUnit2 summit, when asked if "John Doe" had the resources he needed to support Company he responded that “[he] has a third to half the headcount [he] actually needs”.

#### SoftwareTeam
The System software solution suffers from a lack of user adoption, homegrown “solutions” to avoid using the tool, and a general lack of trust in the development team from years of the team being understaffed and as a result unresponsive to customer needs.

They are now having to dig their way out of this hole and rebuild trust with the organization at large, which has likely been more costly than had the group been maintained at appropriate levels consistently throughout the development cycle.

## Appendix A - Persona Level Impacts
Provided by "Fiona" on MM/DD/YYYY:

Okay here’s what I’ve found. It varies quite a bit per role so I’ll send this broken down by role:
* For a CA:	
  *	They spend probably 95% of the time working in the change management space. This includes documenting training, updating Docs, and reviewing CRs/CNs for quality assessment
* For an IPTL:
  *	They spend 10% of their week working on change management tasks
* For a TE:
  *	They spend 5-10% of their time working on CNN during active testing. But, they’ll spend 25-50% in the NC space (a space that triggers things in change management) in a given week, primarily looking through data and developing the course of action
* For an ME that works on tWOs:
  *	They create CNs on a daily basis and this creation takes them ~20 min each time. They also get assigned subtasks on ECRs to either update the tWO or whatever existing instance is out there already. After they submit an CN, rework on CNs can take a minute or two or an hour or two.
* For another ME:
  *	Doing stuff daily but didn’t give a time estimate
* For an RE:
  *	Creating CN 1-2x per week and reviewing 3x a week.
* For a CDM:
  *	“It’s my job role, it’s probably 80% [of their week]. The other 20% [of their week] is meetings around Change Management.”
* For a design lead:	
  *	For CN or CM aspects, probably only 1-2 hours a week, but total time to create each CN is 3 hours. Average is about a month from beginning to end – in terms of actual hours or activity effort expended, probably more like 10 – 40 hours.

## Disclaimer
Everything supplied in this document is a conservative estimate or best guess and is based on broad generalizations that do not fully account for the nuance of each program. As our research into the various BusinessUnit programs continues, the business case for Tool – as well as the rest of the software development portfolio – is subject to change based on new findings, better context, and changing demand from the business unit.
