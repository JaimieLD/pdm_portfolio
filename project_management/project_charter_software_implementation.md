## Background
During the summer of YYYY it was identified by Companyâ€™s executive leadership that there was a need to replace the existing time keeping solution in use. In addition to having a poor user interface and burdensome configurations to maintain, the flash based solution is due to be deprecated by the end of YYYY with the termination of flash support on all major browsers.

## Goals
* Design start to end process that is compatible with existing systems
* Execute implementation of design and go-live prior to MMM DD, YYYY
* Successful end user training rolled out to all users in the company at all locations
* Decommission OldSystem on MMM DD, YYYY

## Scope
The result of this project will be a fully functional time keeping system, for use by all Company employees, that fully integrates with ERPSystem and all applicable modules. The key phases of the project are summarized below under Project Milestones. This project is independent of the current effort underway to automate data flows from HRSystem to ERPSystem. Additionally the automation of data from MRPSystem into the time keeper as well as the flow of data from ERPSystem to HRSystem for payroll processing are considered outside of the scope and will be addressed at a future date as a separate initiative.
